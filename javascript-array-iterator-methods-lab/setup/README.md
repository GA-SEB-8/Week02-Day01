  <span class="subhead">Setup</span>

Then, create an **`app.js`** and an **`index.html`** file. These files will hold your work for this lab:

```bash
touch app.js index.html
```

With the files created, open the contents of the directory in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

Open the **`index.html`** file and add HTML boilerplate. Then link the **`app.js`** file by adding this line inside the `<head>` tag:

```html
<script defer src="./app.js"></script>
```

With this setup complete, we'll have two methods at our disposal for executing the code we write in **`app.js`**:

- Open the **`index.html`** file in your browser and access the console output in your browser's dev tools.
